h1. Using Sinatra with Devise

We need authentication in pretty much every project. If Sinatra Devise (with Rails), Heroku are your weapons of choice, then this project might save you some time.

The commit histories were carefully crafted such that it is easy for people to follow the steps and regenerate this project with new versions of gems.


h2. Usage

1) First, create a new directory

<pre>
mkdir MyApp
cd MyApp
</pre>


2a) Pick a new unique heroku name for your project:

<pre>
export new_project_name=---a-new-name---
heroku create ${new_project_name}
</pre>

2b) Or, let heroku pick one for you and export the name:

<pre>
heroku create
export new_project_name=---a-new-name---
</pre>


3) Run these commands:

<pre>
git init
git remote add origin git@heroku.com:${new_project_name}.git
git remote add baseline git@github.com:beedesk/sinatra-with-devise.git
git pull baseline master
git push -u origin master
heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter --app ${new_project_name}
heroku rake db:migrate --app ${new_project_name}
</pre>
